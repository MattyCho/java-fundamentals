Main.java includes 3 methods: Pluralize, flipNHeads, and clock
Pluralize - takes in 2 arguments, a word and a count, and will pluralize the word based on the count.
flipNHeads - takes in one integer as an argument and will "flip a coin" until the program gets the required number of heads in a row
clock - prints the local time every second.
